  <h2>Guide to data sources</h2>
  
<h5>This guide is a live resource which documents the exploration of new data sources during the development of our new health intelligence resources, and other projects. It also provides a database of sources for use with future work. Where a potential data source is identified through the course of developing our new health intelligence resources it will be catalogued and evaluated here, as such this resource will grow and change as new content is added.</h5>
