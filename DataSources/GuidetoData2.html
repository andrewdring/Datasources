  <h2>Guide to data sources</h2>
  
<h5>This guide is a live resource which documents the exploration of new data sources during the development of our new health intelligence resources, and other projects. It also provides a database of sources for use with future work. Where a potential data source is identified through the course of developing our new health intelligence resources it will be catalogued and evaluated here, as such this resource will grow and change as new content is added.</p>

### Global Burden of Disease
<h2>Global Burden of Disease</h2>

</div>
<table class="table table-striped">
<thread>
<tr><td>

<h3>Purpose</h3> 

<p>
In order to achieve the goal of enabling the global population to live a long life in full health we need a comprehensive picture of what disables and kills people across countries, time, age, and sex. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) provides a tool to quantify health loss from hundreds of diseases, injuries, and risk factors, so that health systems can be improved and disparities can be eliminated.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
The first iteration of the GBD was published in 2010, and since then releases in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017 have followed. The GBD utilises data from 1990 to the present, and is updated semi-annually.

<h3>Representativeness</h3>
<p>
The representativeness of sample is dependent on the data used to model the estimates. For developed countries with robust vital event registration systems and large reliable bodies of scientific evidence such as Wales our full and complete deaths registration data is used giving a highly accurate model.

<h3 id="GBD">Completeness</h3>

<ul>
<li>The GBD is a broad brush stroke comparative tool for national and international data, it cannot be used for precise estimates.</li>

### Food & You
<h2>Food & You</h2>

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><td>
<h3>Purpose</h3> 

<p>
Food and You is a biennial survey exploring the public’s attitudes, reported knowledge and behaviour relating to food safety and other food-related issues. This involves food purchasing, storage, preparation, consumption and factors that may affect these.The survey is based on adults aged 16 years and over living in private households.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
There have been four waves of the Food and You survery which began in January 2008.  The first three waves of the survey were carried out by TNS BMRB (in 2010, 2012 and 2014 respectively). NatCen Social Research (NatCen), in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA), was contracted to carry out Waves 4, and also future Waves 5 and 6 of the survey. Wave 4 (2016) is the most recent.

<li>Year:  4 Waves of the survey between 2010-2016</li>
<li>Topic: Topics have reflected the priorities and interests of the Food Standards Agency (FSA);
Wave 1 assessed consumer attitudes and behaviour to food-related issues falling under the FSA’s remit.
Wave 2  focussed on food safety and hygiene issues.
Wave 3  was designed to monitor changes since the previous two waves in attitudes and reported behaviour about food issues, to identify at-risk groups for food safety issues, and to explore public understanding of issues regarding the FSA’s targets.
Wave 4 of the Food and You Survey included new questions to cover affordability of food, choice, security and sustainability.</li>
<li>Age and sex: males, females, persons aged 16 and over</li>
<li>Measures: Attitudes, reported knowledge and behaviour relating to food safety and other food-related issues</li>

<h3>Representativeness</h3>

Random probability sampling ensures that everyone in the included countries has an equal chance of being selected to take part, so the results are representative of the population.

<h3>Known caveats or limitations</h3>

<p>The Food and You survey is self-reported data which has a number of limitations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Using interviews as a data collection method does not directly capture people’s actual practices for a number of reasons, including recall not being accurate, certain behaviours being habitual and therefore possibly difficult to recall, and desirability bias.</li> 
<li>Here self-reported behaviour is used as a proxy for actual behaviour. Where the report refers to behaviour, attitudes or knowledge, the fact that the data refer to reported behaviour must always be borne in mind.</li> 
<li>The risk of social desirability bias is also high i.e. respondents tend to answer questions based on what they think they ought to say, rather than reflecting what they actually do, know or think.</li>
